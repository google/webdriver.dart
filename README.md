Dart WebDriver client

Installing
----------


1. Depend on it
   Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

   ```YAML
   dependencies:
     webdriver: any
   ```

   If your package is an application package you should use any as the version constraint.

2. Install it
   If you're using the Dart Editor, choose:

   ```
   Menu > Tools > Pub Install
   ```

   Or if you want to install from the command line, run:

   ```
   $ pub install
   ```

3. Import it
   Now in your Dart code, you can use:

   ```Dart
   import 'package:webdriver/webdriver.dart';
   ```
