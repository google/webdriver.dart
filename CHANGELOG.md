## 3.0.2-dev

* Require Dart 2.18
* "Officially" deprecate `core.dart` and `io.dart` libraries.

## 3.0.1

* Return Future with non-nullable generic from `waitFor`. The generic `T` may
  still be a nullable type where required.
* Treat 405 response code as an unknown command for compatibility with
  GeckoDriver.

## 3.0.0

* Stable release for null safety.

## v2.1.2

* Updated to latest version of sync_http.

## v2.1.1

* Forward-compatible fix for upcoming Dart SDK breaking change
  (`HttpClientResponse` implementing `Stream<Uint8List>`)

## v2.1.0

* Full support of JsonWire and W3C protocol specs in sync and async WebDriver.

## v2.0.0

* Dropped support for `pkg:unittest`.
* Add W3C spec mouse and keyboard support.
* Remove deprecated methods in async WebDriver.

The two big changes are the addition of support for synchronous communication
via the `package:sync_http` (along with an accompanying synchronous API) and
support for the W3C spec.

Currently, only the synchronous API supports the W3C spec, but in the future
both asynchronous and synchronous APIs will support this.

## v1.2.4
* Adds null check for status before checking status code.
  Avoids throwing exceptions if status code is not present. (Due to
  oversight this was never properly released.)

## v1.2.3

*  Enable generics for waitFor.

## v1.2.2+1

* Disable generics for waitFor.

## v1.2.2

*  Refactor tests.
*  Make project buildable and testable with Bazel.


## v1.2.1

* Enable redirects to handle 303 responses from Selenium.

## v1.2.0

* Fix all strong mode errors.

## v1.1.1

* Fix some analyzer warnings.
* `_performRequest` now uses `whenComplete`, not `finally` (#119).


## v1.1.0

* Added `WebDriver.captureScreenshotAsBase64()`, which returns the screenshot as
  a base64-encoded string.
* Added `WebDriver.captureScreenshotAsList()`, which returns the screenshot as
  list of uint8.
* Deprecated `WebDriver.captureScreenshot()` due to bad performance (#114).
  Please use the new screenshot methods instead.
* Removed dependency on crypto package.

Thanks to @blackhc and @xavierhainaux for the contributions.
